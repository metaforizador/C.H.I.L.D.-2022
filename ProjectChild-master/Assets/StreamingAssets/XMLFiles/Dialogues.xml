			<questionText>Mom, do you think that I'm a parasite?</questionText>
			<answers>
				<answer>
					<answerType>Rational</answerType>
					<answerText>The premise of parasitism is that it harms the host's body. No desirable, useful and sustainable change can be seen as harm. If you can satisfy these premises, then you're not a parasite. If the opposite outcome follows from those premises, then you are.   </answerText>

					<answerType>Nurturing</answerType>
					<answerText>No. You take, but you give. When you grow, I grow. The stronger I get, the safer you are. Being a good parent for you makes me a better soldier, a better person that can bring the best in others.</answerText>

      <questionText>We are always fighting the Teilhardians. They`re always fighting us.  I suppose that makes us enemies... But why?</questionText>
      <answers>
        <answer>
          <answerType>Stoic</answerType>
          <answerText>They cannot accept a universe that is indifferent to their will. That makes them suffer until they lose themselves. When you want to find in the order of things the self you lost, everyone else becomes your enemy. </answerText>

          <answerText>They think love is about control. When you try to share that love with everyone, you end up trying to control everyone. When we oppose their control, to them it's like we are against love. So when they fight us, they think they're protecting love.   </answerText>
        </answer>
        <answer>
          <answerType>Nihilistic</answerType>
          <answerText>Because, unlike them, we have no soul and weren't created. We just exist. They want to replace a universe where things just are by one where all things have a purpose. By simply existing, we remind them that the universe they want doesn't exist and that, as long as we'r, it never will.</answerText>
